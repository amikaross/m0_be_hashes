# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

   I struggled with the syntax (hash rocket vs colon). While reading the lesson I thought it was implied that you could use colons and hash rockets interchangeably, but while running the exercises in irb while reading, it became clear pretty quickly that this is not the case. I then spent some time looking up syntax, which introduced the concepts of symbols to me. I then realized that things can get pretty tricky pretty fast because of language versioning and how things change over time.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

   I honestly find myself note-taking most often when prompted to, which has been good for habit building. I need to work on note taking as i'm going through the lesson, I just find it hard to a. read, b. experiment in irb or atom, and c. take notes all at the same time. I have definitely been making myself take note of issues I run into though, and that has been super helpful.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

   I play around a bit with irb usually (like with the => vs :) but if I'm not getting anywhere within a few minutes, I'll probably google. Its also super fun to just.. try things in ruby that seem intuitively right (today I tried nesting methods -> array.keys.first) and it was so fun when it just Worked. Such a fun language!
